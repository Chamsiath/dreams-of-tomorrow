      <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

      <p>This project was made possible through the support and encouragement of many people. I am deeply thankful to my parents and family for their patience and constant motivation. Their kindness and belief in me gave me strength throughout this journey.<br>

I also appreciate the guidance of my teachers, whose advice helped me understand how to express ideas with creativity and meaning. In addition, I acknowledge the online resources and tools that helped me learn how to design, structure, and code this website from scratch.<br>

Every piece of help, big or small, became part of the dream that shaped <i>Dreams of Tomorrow.</i></p>

      <h3>Purpose & Takeaways</h3>
      <p><i>Dreams of Tomorrow</i> is not just a website of stories to read and enjoy, but rather a collection of dreams from different individuals — some happy, some sad — yet all carrying the same message: <b>“Believe in yourself. Follow what you love, but also what is right.”</b><br>

This website is especially for teenagers and young people who are struggling to find what they want to be, struggling to express themselves, and struggling to look at their dreams and work towards them.<br>

Here is a message from me to you:<br>
– You can never gain something without losing something else.<br>
– You cannot make a decision and expect everyone to agree with it.<br>
– And lastly, you can never dream of something that doesn’t exist — it can, maybe in this world, maybe in your thoughts, maybe in your dreams.<br>

Believe. Have hope. Never give up.<br>
No matter how hard it may be, no matter how impossible it may seem…<br>
<b>Dream — dream of tomorrow.</b><br>

<i>Thank you.</i></p>
