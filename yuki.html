The sun was setting over the Tokyo athletics field, casting long shadows across the red track. Yuki’s heartbeat thundered in her ears as she sprinted toward the finish line. The crowd blurred into color, the wind brushed against her face, and her shoes pounded rhythmically against the ground.
<br>She crossed the line with a triumphant shout. Another gold medal. Her teammates rushed to her side, cheering, while her coach clapped proudly from afar.
<br>At home, Yuki hung the medal beside her others—each one shining proof of her hard work. She smiled at her reflection in the mirror. “One day, I’ll run for Japan,” she whispered to herself.
<br>That was before the accident.
<br>A week later, her world turned upside down. The rain was pouring heavily that night. Her father had been driving her home from training when a truck skidded into their lane. She fell—the world tilting violently, the smell of blood sharp in her nose. She remembered the blinding headlights, the screech of tires, her father’s scream, then darkness.
<br>“Papa! Papa!” she screamed, hands clawing at the ground.
<br>Her father, his head bleeding, called the ambulance. He turned to Yuki and said, “Yuki! Hold on! Help is coming!”
<br>The doctors told her afterward that there was nothing they could do to save her leg. Amputation—the word echoed in her mind, cold and final.
<br>“No…” she whispered. “No, no, no!”
<br>Her mother rushed to her side, eyes swollen from crying. “Yuki, please… listen to me. You’re alive, sweetheart. That’s all that matters.”
<br>But Yuki didn’t hear. Her medals flashed in her mind, glittering with mockery.
<br>Days turned into weeks. The pain of the surgery faded, but a heavier pain settled in her chest. She stopped going to school. She refused to meet her old teammates. Her once bright room felt like a stranger’s place.
<br>When she finally returned to school, whispers followed her down the hallway.
<br>“Is that Yuki? The track star?”
<br>“She’s in a wheelchair now.”
<br>“Poor thing. What a waste.”
<br>Every word pierced her like a blade, each whisper another reminder of what she’d lost.
<br>In P.E., her teacher, Ms. Aoi, hesitated before calling attendance. “Sato-san… you can sit this one out.”
<br>(‘Sato-san’ simply means Ms. Sato. In Japan, we use honorifics to be formal and polite.)
<br>At lunch, a girl deliberately bumped into her chair, spilling water across Yuki’s tray. “Oops,” she said with a smirk. “Guess you can’t run from that either.”
<br>Her hands trembled, but she stayed silent.
<br>That evening, she sat by the window, staring at the medals that once made her proud. They glimmered faintly in the fading sunlight. “What good are you now?” she whispered. A tear rolled down her cheek, falling soundlessly onto her lap.
<br>The days passed in monotony until one afternoon, when she was leaving the library, her chair snagged on a ramp’s edge. A boy her age rushed over.
<br>“Hold on, I’ve got it,” he said, kneeling to help. He pushed gently, freeing the wheel.
<br>“Thanks,” Yuki muttered, avoiding eye contact.
<br>“No problem. I’m Shinobu. Shinobu Yamaguchi.”
<br>She gave a polite nod. “Yuki Sato.”
<br>He smiled. “I know. You were on the news once, right? The sprinter?”
<br>Her chest tightened. “Was,” she replied quietly.
<br>“Hmm,” Shinobu said thoughtfully. “I still see one sitting here, though.”
<br>Yuki blinked. “What?”
<br>He shrugged. “You might not be running now, but I can tell. You’ve still got that fire.”
<br>“But how can a fire exist when it’s already been extinguished?” asked Yuki softly.
<br>“Sato-san,” he said, touching his chest lightly, “the fire here burns longer than the one in your legs.” His blue eyes gleamed under the sunset rays.
<br>“Good luck. See ya!” he said as he walked away.
<br>Yuki stared after him, unsure why her heart suddenly felt lighter.
<br>The next day, during break time, the air buzzed with chatter and laughter. Yuki wheeled herself toward her usual quiet corner near the vending machines. She put in coins and got a juice box and a packet of chips.
<br>As she reached for her drink, two girls from her old track team passed by.
<br>“Did you hear?” one whispered. “Coach said Yuki used to finish a hundred meters in twelve seconds. Now she can’t even cross the hallway without help.”
<br>The other giggled. “Guess her new sport’s rolling instead of running.”
<br>Yuki froze as a lump formed in her throat. The straw in her hand bent under her tightening grip.
<br>They didn’t stop there. One leaned closer, her perfume heavy and sweet. “You were so lucky, Yuki. Everyone used to cheer for you. Guess fame’s easier to lose than a leg, huh?”
<br>The laughter that followed stung more than the accident ever had. Yuki felt something hot rise in her chest—anger, shame, and helplessness all tangled together.
<br>“I didn’t choose this!” she suddenly shouted, her voice breaking. The hallway went silent. “Do you think I wanted this?! To lose everything? Akari! Hana! Why are you so cruel?!”
<br>The girls blinked, startled, then stepped closer.
<br>“Well, well, well… it seems somebody hasn’t learned her lesson,” Akari said, gripping Yuki’s wheelchair handle.
<br>Hana snatched Yuki’s chips and juice. Akari jerked the wheelchair backward, then shoved it forward, sending Yuki tumbling to the floor.
<br>The cold tiles hit her palms, pain searing through her hands and knees. She gasped as her chair rolled away. Hana tossed a five-yen coin at her; it struck her forehead, leaving a red mark.
<br>“Keep the change!” Hana called mockingly as their laughter echoed down the hall.
<br>Yuki stayed on the floor for a long moment, her breath shaking. Tears spilled down her cheeks, hot and heavy, mixing with the dirt on the tiles. For the first time since the accident, she wished she could disappear.
<br>Then came a calm voice. “You shouldn’t let them define what you’ve already survived.”
<br>Yuki turned. A girl who looked strikingly like Shinobu stood there, her bag slung carelessly over one shoulder, a faint smile softening her face.
<br>“Are you Shinobu’s younger sister?” Yuki asked, wiping her tears with the back of her sleeve.
<br>The girl nodded. “The name’s Hanae, Class 11-A.”
<br>She grabbed Yuki’s wheelchair and helped her sit up gently.
<br>“In which class are you?” asked Hanae.
<br>“Class 10-C,” Yuki murmured.
<br>Hanae began pushing her toward the classroom.
<br>“I never got your name,” Hanae said quietly.
<br>“My name is Yuki. Yuki Sato.”
<br>Hanae smiled faintly. “Then, Yuki Sato… don’t look down too long. The ground doesn’t deserve your gaze.”
<br>And before Yuki could reply, Hanae turned and walked away, her voice echoing down the hall like a soft promise.
<br>For the first time in months, Yuki didn’t feel small.
<br>The next morning, Yuki rolled through the school gates with the usual weight in her chest. But for the first time in months, something small and strange flickered beneath it—a quiet curiosity.
<br>As she approached her classroom, someone tapped her shoulder lightly.
<br>“Morning, Sato-san!” It was Hanae, her brown hair tied up messily, a bright grin lighting her face.
<br>“Morning,” Yuki replied shyly.
<br>Hanae leaned on Yuki’s desk as though they’d known each other for years. “You know, Shinobu told me about you. Said you were the fastest person he’s ever seen.”
<br>Yuki’s cheeks warmed. “He… said that?”
<br>“Yup,” Hanae said, popping the ‘p’. “He doesn’t usually talk about people, so that’s saying something.”
<br>Just then, Shinobu appeared by the doorway, holding three cans of strawberry milk. “I thought I’d find you two together,” he said with a grin. “Here. Breakfast for champions.”
<br>Yuki blinked, startled. “You brought this for me?”
<br>“Of course,” Shinobu said casually. “You can’t heal on an empty stomach.”
<br>Hanae laughed. “He acts all cool, but he stayed up late designing a new ramp for the school steps. Said it was ‘for a friend.’”
<br>Shinobu groaned. “You weren’t supposed to tell her that!”
<br>Yuki giggled softly—an unfamiliar sound that surprised even her. For a moment, the heaviness inside her eased.
<br>At lunch, the three of them sat under the sakura tree in the courtyard. Petals drifted through the air, landing gently on Yuki’s lap. Hanae stuck one in Yuki’s hair with exaggerated care.
<br>“There. Perfect.”
<br>Yuki smiled, really smiled. “You two are weird.”
<br>“Thank you,” Shinobu said proudly.
<br>Hanae leaned back against the tree trunk. “You know, maybe being fast isn’t always about running. Sometimes, it’s about how quickly you find people who see you for who you are.”
<br>“A, B, C, D, E, F, G,” Shinobu suddenly began to sing under his breath, rocking side to side.
<br>“Seriously?” Hanae said, giving him a look. “You’re ruining the moment!”
<br>He shrugged. “I was trying to lighten the mood.”
<br>Yuki burst into laughter—the sound was bright and genuine, surprising even her. The laughter spread to Hanae, who started giggling too, and soon all three of them were laughing beneath the cherry blossoms.
<br>When the laughter finally faded, Yuki looked at them both—Shinobu’s calm, kind eyes and Hanae’s playful warmth—and felt something she hadn’t felt in a long time: safety.
<br>For the first time since the accident, she didn’t feel like a broken piece of her old self. She felt like Yuki again.
<br>As the afternoon sunlight filtered through the pink blossoms, she thought quietly to herself, Maybe… this is what healing looks like.
<br>The next morning, Yuki wheeled herself into the classroom, Hanae by her side and Shinobu trailing with a small thermos of warm tea he insisted she drink. The school smelled like fresh paper and chalk, and the sun streamed through the windows, casting soft patterns on the floor.
<br>During the morning assembly, the entire school gathered in the auditorium. The chatter buzzed softly until the head girl stepped up to the microphone, her voice clear and calm.
<br>“Good morning, everyone. This is to announce that this year’s Bunkasai (school festival) shall be held in the following months. So prepare your presentations and acts and show this school what you’ve got. Thank you,” said the head girl while bowing slightly as a round of applause followed.
<br>“Good morning, everyone!” the head boy, Shinobu, spoke. “This is to inform you that the Tokyo Olympics are to be held on August the 4th, and the Tokyo Paralympics on October the 21st, so try your best and make the school proud. You got this!” Shinobu said, making the school clap even louder.
<br>The sun was setting over the Tokyo athletics field, casting long shadows across the red track. Yuki’s heartbeat thundered in her ears as she sprinted toward the finish line. The crowd blurred into color, the wind brushed against her face, and her shoes pounded rhythmically against the ground.<br>

Yuki burst into laughter—the sound was bright and genuine. For the first time since the accident, she didn’t feel broken. She felt like Yuki again.<br>

The next morning, Yuki wheeled herself into the classroom, Hanae by her side and Shinobu trailing with a thermos of tea. During the morning assembly, the head boy and girl announced the upcoming school festival and the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.<br>
As the words echoed through the hall, Yuki’s heart fluttered. The word “Paralympics” lit a spark inside her.<br>
Shinobu whispered, “See? That fire’s still there.”<br>
After the assembly, Hanae grabbed her hand. “Come on! Let’s celebrate this announcement properly!”<br>

In the courtyard, they found the sports booth. Ms. Aoi greeted them warmly and told Yuki about her brother Takeshi, who could help her train—either for wheelchair racing or prosthetic running.<br>
Yuki thought deeply, then said with newfound resolve, “I want to run again.”<br>
Takeshi grinned. “Then let’s make that happen.”<br>

He helped her learn the rhythm of prosthetic running, guiding her step by step. Hanae cheered, Shinobu joked, and laughter filled every training session. Slowly, Yuki’s fear melted away, replaced by strength.<br>

On the day of the competition, banners waved and the crowd buzzed with excitement. Yuki took her place at the starting line, Takeshi adjusting her prosthetic one last time.<br>
“You’ve got this,” he said quietly.<br>
The pistol fired.<br>

The wind hit her face; the world blurred. Her body remembered. Her heart soared.<br>
When she crossed the finish line, the announcer’s voice echoed: “First place—Yuki Sato!”<br>
The stadium erupted. Hanae screamed her name. Shinobu waved like a madman. Takeshi smiled with pride.<br>

For the first time since the accident, Yuki felt whole again—not because she had won, but because she had remembered what it felt like to chase her dreams, surrounded by friends who believed in her.<br>
Under the bright stadium lights, she whispered to herself, “This is only the beginning.”
