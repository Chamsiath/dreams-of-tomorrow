“Lucas, are you ready?” asked his mother.<br>
“I don’t want to go to the dentist!” cried Lucas, stomping his foot.<br>
“But you have to. It’s for your own good. You need to wear braces,” his mother said, opening the car door for him. Lucas reluctantly climbed in, mumbling under his breath as they headed toward the hospital.<br>
“I hate doctors!” Lucas puffed, crossing his arms.<br>
“But doctors save lives,” his mother replied calmly. “When I had complications during your birth, it was a doctor who brainstormed and performed a C-section as a last resort—to save both your life and mine.”<br>
“Hmph!” Lucas puffed again, rolling his eyes.<br>
Lucas was a Norwegian boy living in Birmingham. He loved chocolate and detested hard candy. His mother, Elena, a passionate Spanish woman, loved spicy dishes that made him squirm.<br>
Doctors, however, were Lucas’s ultimate nemesis. He had never liked them, and, for some reason, they never seemed to like him.<br>
When they arrived at the dentist’s office, Lucas clutched the doorframe. The dentist smiled warmly, holding a shiny tray of tools.<br>
“Alright, Lucas, let’s get you that perfect smile,” she said.<br>
“I said I hate this!” Lucas shouted, flinching at the sound of the drill in the background.<br>
Then something unexpected happened. A small, squirming puppy from the waiting room ran in, chased by a giggling little girl. Lucas froze. The puppy tripped, somersaulted, and landed right on Lucas’s shoes. He blinked, then burst out laughing.<br>
“Look at him!” Lucas giggled. “He’s worse at walking than I am at sitting still!”<br>
The dentist raised an eyebrow. “Maybe that’s your spirit animal,” she teased. Lucas laughed so hard he almost forgot about the braces.<br>
As the procedure began, Lucas’s nervous energy turned into tiny jokes. “Hey, don’t poke my tongue with that thing! I swear it bites back,” he said, earning a quiet chuckle from the dental nurse.<br>
Minutes felt like hours, but Lucas managed to sit still long enough for the braces to be placed. When the dentist finally said he was done, Lucas blinked in disbelief at the shiny new braces and then grinned.<br>
“I still don’t love doctors,” Lucas admitted reluctantly, “but… that wasn’t so bad. And I got a puppy to laugh at!”<br>
His mother smiled, ruffling his hair. “See? Change can be scary at first, but sometimes it brings funny little surprises.”<br>
Lucas looked at his reflection in the metal tray. “Okay… maybe I can survive this,” he muttered, already imagining all the funny faces he could make with his new braces.<br><br>

<b>Three Years Later…</b><br>
“Lucas?” said the teacher.<br>
“Yes,” Lucas answered, his voice sore from speaking too quickly.<br>
“Sit down, please. And Lucas…” The teacher paused, eyes softening. “I hear you’ve… been helping around town lately?”<br>
Lucas swallowed. He had been spending evenings trailing small mysteries in the neighborhood: missing bikes, suspicious noises at the old library, even a case of a cat that had somehow vanished for three days. Detective work had become his refuge, though it wasn’t exactly what his parents had in mind.<br>
“Y-yes, ma’am,” he murmured, cheeks warming.<br>
The teacher nodded and returned to the board. Lucas slumped in his chair, thinking: detective work, at least, didn’t involve scissors, scalpel blades, or any of those nightmares that had haunted him in biology class last year. He had nearly fainted the first time he had to look at a frog for dissection. Even the smell of formaldehyde made him shiver.<br>
His mother had been ecstatic when he showed improvement in math and science. “Maybe you’ll grow up to be a doctor,” she had said brightly. But the thought of handling blood and organs? That had been a terror he couldn’t quite shake. The small detective cases he chased were a perfect escape.<br>
The first case of the semester came quietly, slipping in almost unnoticed. The principal’s cat, Whiskers, had gone missing, and the school was buzzing with whispers. Lucas’s ears perked up at the chance to investigate.<br>
He took a notebook, scribbled observations, and started asking questions. Unlike the doctor’s office, no one expected him to perform or risk getting hurt. He followed tiny clues: a scrap of red ribbon here, a paw print in the mud there.<br>
Hours later, Lucas found Whiskers stuck in the janitor’s closet. The cat hissed and swatted at him, but he held firm, whispering softly, “I’ve got you, little one.” He realized he wasn’t shaking—not nearly as much as he would have when confronting the frog in the bio lab.<br>
The cat then jumped and scratched him on the cheek.<br>
“Aw! You little whiskers,” Lucas said.<br>
He gave the cat back to the principal the next morning.<br>
“Good morning, Mrs. Maples. Your cat,” he said as he handed it over.<br>
“Oh, thank you!” said the principal, hugging him.<br>
“Ma’am, stop hugging me!” Lucas said, annoyed.<br>
The principal started chuckling. “So now your aunt can’t hug you anymore?”<br>
“Not at school, ma’am… it’s embarrassing,” Lucas muttered, blushing.<br>
Mrs. Maples burst out laughing. “You’re afraid your classmates will make fun of you, am I correct?”<br>
As she calmed down, she asked, “What happened to your cheek?”<br>
“Oh, your cat scratched me,” he replied, which made her laugh again.<br>
Feeling humiliated enough, Lucas quickly left the office.<br>
A junior who was heading to the principal’s office saw Lucas’s red face and Mrs. Maples laughing inside. “What happened?” the junior asked.<br>
“Nothing!” Lucas said, turning even redder with embarrassment.<br>
The junior began giggling as he entered the principal’s office.<br><br>

The next week, the biology teacher announced dissections: frogs, and this time, it was mandatory. Lucas froze. The same panic that had once made him flee from the lab came back full force. His mother had called him that morning:<br>
“Lucas, this is part of growing up. A doctor faces all sorts of things. You’re strong enough.”<br>
Lucas clenched his fists. “I don’t want to be a doctor,” he whispered to himself, though somewhere deep down, he knew she believed in him. “I just… want to be me,” he sighed silently.<br>
That night, he lay awake thinking about the dissection.<br><br>

The day of the dissection arrived. Lucas’s heart pounded. He was so afraid that he hadn’t even gotten forty winks. He looked at the frog, at the scalpel, at the other students moving confidently.<br>
“Mr. Nilsen Lucas, what happened? You seem to be quite sleepy,” said his biology teacher, Ms. Elenor.<br>
“Oh, I am sorry…” he mumbled sleepily.<br>
He lifted the scalpel, trembling, and then fell onto the floor. He fainted due to lack of sleep.<br>
When Lucas opened his eyes, he was lying on the nurse’s cot, the fluorescent lights glaring above him. A faint smell of antiseptic and something vaguely like old orange juice filled the air.<br>
“Mr. Nilsen, are you feeling better?” asked Ms. Elenor, her eyebrows raised.<br>
“I… I think so,” Lucas whispered, rubbing his head. “Did I… faint?”<br>
“Yes,” she said gently. “Right in the middle of class. And, Lucas…” She leaned closer, lowering her voice as if sharing a secret. “You may have set a new school record.”<br>
Lucas blinked. “Record?”<br>
“For the fastest faint-to-floor maneuver,” she said, trying to hide a smirk. “You went out before your classmates even realized you were holding a scalpel. Impressive coordination, if you ask me.”<br>
Lucas groaned, embarrassed. He could already hear the whispers: Lucas fainted during frog dissection. Again.<br>
The nurse gave him a small cup of water. “Drink. And try not to pass out again today.”<br>
Lucas muttered, “Easy for you to say…”<br><br>

After a few minutes, Ms. Elenor returned with a mischievous smile. “I have an idea,” she said. “Since you clearly have… unique reactions to biology, why don’t you try observing first? You can be the ‘chief detective’ of frog anatomy today.”<br>
Lucas’s eyes widened. “Detective?”<br>
“Exactly,” she said, placing a tiny magnifying glass in his hands. “You can note clues, observe patterns, write down what you see. No touching. Detective Lucas at work.”<br>
He blinked. Slowly, a tiny smile formed on his face. He could do that. Observation was his thing. Puzzle-solving was his thing. Fainting—well, he’d try to avoid that.<br>
By the end of the period, Lucas had drawn diagrams with more attention to detail than anyone else in class. He even added little notes: <i>Frog has surprisingly soft toes</i> and <i>Eyes slightly creepy, like the principal’s cat at night.</i><br>
The class erupted in laughter when Ms. Elenor read the notes aloud. Even Lucas couldn’t help but giggle.<br>
“You’re not just facing your fears,” Ms. Elenor said as he packed up. “You’re turning them into your strengths.”<br>
“Thank you ma’am,” Lucas said, smiling.<br><br>

That evening, he couldn’t stop recounting the day to his parents. “I didn’t touch the frog!” he said proudly. “I observed it! And I… wrote detective notes!”<br>
His mother Elena nodded, hiding a smile. “Good. That’s progress, Lucas. That’s very… detective-like of you.”<br>
His father chuckled. “Just make sure your detective work doesn’t involve me finding frogs in the living room.”<br>
Lucas laughed. “No promises.”<br><br>

Lucas began watching doctor videos. Not because he liked them, but because he wanted to understand what they really did.<br>
“Doctors want people to smile by curing them,” Lucas murmured to himself. “Detectives want people to smile by solving cases.” He paused for a moment, a faint grin curling on his lips. “Finally, a resemblance.”<br>
Weeks passed, and Lucas began asking questions—many questions. His teacher was impressed. “Lucas, I think you’ve got a scientist’s mind.”<br>
He smiled. “Maybe a doctor’s mind.”<br>
From then on, Lucas’s notebooks were filled with sketches of organs, anatomy notes, and doodles of detectives shaking hands with doctors.<br><br>

Years later, Lucas had finished high school and was now in his first year of medical university. Sometimes, when he sat in lecture halls filled with white-coated students and strange chemical smells, he still wondered if he had made the right choice. The thought of syringes, the sound of scalpels being laid on trays, and the sharp scent of antiseptic still made his stomach twist.<br>
Then, one afternoon, everything changed.<br>
His mother had fallen ill. It started as mild chest pain but worsened over the weeks. Soon, the doctors said the word Lucas dreaded most—surgery.<br>
He sat outside the operating room, his legs trembling. “Please, let her be fine,” he whispered, his voice breaking. Hours passed like days until finally, the surgeon stepped out.<br>
“She’s stable,” the man said gently, removing his gloves. “The operation went well.”<br>
Lucas sprang to his feet, tears gathering in his eyes. “Thank you! I—I don’t even know how to thank you!”<br>
The surgeon smiled. “Then promise me you’ll take care of her.”<br>
Lucas nodded, unable to speak. Later, when his mother was recovering, Lucas gathered his courage and approached the surgeon again.<br>
“Sir,” he began hesitantly, “I’m studying medicine now, but... sometimes I feel scared. Of the blood, the injections, the pressure. What if I’m not good enough?”<br>
The surgeon chuckled softly. “Lucas, everyone is afraid at first. Fear doesn’t mean you’re weak—it means you understand how serious what you’re doing is. But the best doctors aren’t those without fear. They’re the ones who control it and use it to stay careful, steady, and human.”<br>
Lucas looked down, his mind turning the words over and over. Control fear... use it.<br>
The surgeon continued, “Courage isn’t about feeling brave. It’s about acting right even when you’re terrified. The first time I held a scalpel, my hands were shaking. But I thought of the life before me, and my fear transformed into focus.”<br><br>

That night, Lucas sat beside his mother’s bed. He brushed his finger against his mother's hand. The beeping of the heart monitor was steady, like a reminder that life was fragile, but also strong.<br>
He smiled faintly. “Maybe... maybe I can do this too.”<br>
From that day onward, Lucas studied differently. He spent long nights in the library reading about human anatomy, volunteering at clinics, even holding syringes to desensitize himself. He still flinched sometimes, but he laughed about it now.<br>
One day, while helping in a small procedure at the campus hospital, the supervising nurse looked over and said, “You’ve got steady hands for a student.”<br>
Lucas grinned, recalling the surgeon’s advice. “Maybe fear makes them steady,” he whispered softly. “Use fear as a barrier to surpass, not as a limit you cannot pass.”<br><br>

<b>Fourteen Years Later…</b><br>
“Doctor Lucas? The patient’s vitals are stable,” said a nurse briskly, walking beside him down a gleaming hospital corridor.<br>
Lucas, now in his thirties, adjusted his surgical gloves and nodded. “Good. Let’s prepare for the bypass.”<br>
Medical students followed him like ducklings, whispering among themselves, their faces filled with awe. Lucas remembered being one of them once—watching from afar, full of doubt, fear, and a thousand questions.<br>
As he reached the doors of the operation room, he paused. The lights above gleamed. The instruments were lined up like a soldier’s ranks.<br>
He smiled faintly and said, “What an intriguing operation!”<br>
The students looked at him curiously, not understanding the weight of those words. But Lucas did. For the boy who once feared doctors was now one himself—the fearful child who had learned to heal not only others but his own heart.<br>
