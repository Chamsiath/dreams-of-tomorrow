<b>One year post-Holocaust…</b><br>
“Joseph, are you ready for your first day at school?” asked his mother, Sarah.<br>
“Ima, I don’t want to go to school,” replied Joseph, tears welling up in his eyes.<br>
Ima means ‘mother’ in Hebrew.<br>
Sarah hugged him tightly. “Oh, my poor little honey,” she whispered. “You’re safe now. You’ll see, everything will be alright.”<br>
Joseph Cohen, twelve years old, had come from a war-torn Germany. His family had fled after suffering unimaginable losses during the genocide caused by the Nazi regime. Joseph himself had lost his sight when a piece of shrapnel pierced his eyes. His younger sister, Abigail, and his father, Moshe, were gone. Now he lived in a small house with his mother and her brother, Benjamin.<br>
The family’s resources were limited; three square meals a day were a luxury they could not always afford. The government had done them a “favor,” providing a small house and free education.<br>
The classroom was buzzing with whispers when Joseph entered, his hand brushing along the wall to guide him. He felt the soft tap of the teacher’s hand on his shoulder and heard her voice:<br>
“Class, we have a new student today. Joseph, would you like to introduce yourself?”<br>
Joseph’s voice was soft but steady. “I’m Joseph Cohen. I’m from Germany.”<br>
Immediately, the murmurs began. Some students whispered among themselves, glancing at his curled peyos, the traditional sidelocks that marked his faith. A few others stared at his brownish-blonde hair, confused.<br>
“Is he… a Jew?” someone muttered.<br>
The questions and stares made Joseph shrink slightly in his chair. He had faced so much, but the discomfort of being singled out never got easier.<br>
Just then, a dark-skinned boy in the back of the room looked up. His name was Isma’il. He had always been quiet, often the target of subtle and not-so-subtle prejudice because of the color of his skin. Isma’il turned toward Joseph, and a small nod passed between them. A silent understanding of what it felt like to be judged before being known.<br>
In that instant, Joseph realized he wasn’t entirely alone.<br>
He went to the back of the classroom and sat beside Isma’il. Isma’il felt a flicker of shyness. He hugged his books to his chest, shrinking slightly, and for a moment, he felt exposed, no one had ever chosen to sit near him before. Slowly, he began to feel a deep unease about his own skin, comparing himself to others and valuing white-skinned individuals more than himself. His mother had been sold as a slave to the royal family and now worked as a maid in the palace; he saw her only rarely, if at all. His father, a skilled farmer, had earned the king’s favor to such an extent that the child’s tuition was covered entirely, yet the comforts of school could not shield Isma’il from the quiet ache of his own self-doubt.<br>
“Good morning," Joseph said, facing the opposite side.<br>
“Um, Joseph, I am at your left,” said Isma’il shyly.<br>
“Isma’il… are you a Muslim?” he asked this time facing him.<br>
“Yes, I am a Muslim. My parents are from Ethiopia," Isma’il answered.<br>
Joseph brought out his hand for a handshake but Isma’il didn’t touch Joseph’s hand.<br>
“You don’t like handshakes?” Joseph questioned.<br>
“Well, you see, I am black so… blacks touching white skin is considered insane. As though I am an untouchable,” Isma’il said as a tear fell on the table.<br>
Joseph then started touching Isma’il’s face.<br>
“Why are you touching my face?” Isma’il questioned.<br>
“Blind people usually touch faces to recognize the face pattern so that next time they know who they are in case of liars. Please Isma’il, stop crying. The fact that you are black, the fact that you are a Muslim or the fact that whatever is making you cry is not for the right cause. You are crying due to low self-esteem. Please do not cry, ever because of your race. Hold my hand,” said Joseph.<br>
Then Isma’il held Joseph’s hands.<br>
“You see? Not all fingers are equal but each is unique and has a role. The same applies to society. Okay?” said Joseph.<br>
“Okay,” Isma’il said.<br>
“Um, Joseph?” said Isma’il.<br>
“Yes?” Joseph answered.<br>
“Are you an Arab?” Isma’il asked.<br>
“I came from an Arab descendant so yes we can say that. But my nationality is German,” said Joseph.<br>
“You can write even though you can’t see?” Isma’il asked.<br>
“Yes, I can write both Braille and English,” Joseph answered.<br>
A man rang the bell and so the first period began.<br>
Home time…<br>
“Joseph!” the mother called as she walked towards him.<br>
“So how was school?” the mother asked.<br>
“It was fine, Ima,” said Joseph.<br>
She chuckled and brought him back home.<br>
The next day, Joseph walked into the school courtyard with a quiet sense of determination. He had memorized the layout of the school, the positions of the benches, even the texture of the gravel on the path, and yet, his heart thumped as he sensed the whispers before he even reached his classroom.<br>
“Look… it’s the blind boy!” someone sneered.<br>
“He’s a Jew, right? From Germany?” another added, their voices dripping with mockery.<br>
Joseph’s stomach tightened, but he held his head high. He could not see the faces staring at him, but he felt the hostility like sharp winds on bare skin.<br>
As he neared the entrance, a group of boys lunged forward. Joseph’s notebooks were snatched from his bag.<br>
“Hey! Give them back!” he called, his voice trembling.<br>
The boys laughed cruelly, tossing his notebooks into the air. Joseph could hear the splash before he realized what had happened: his carefully written notes were sinking into the pond behind the school. He reached out, hands grasping at water and mud, but it was no use.<br>
“Stop it! Stop!” he shouted, but the boys weren’t finished. One shoved him lightly in the back, another pushed at his shoulder. Joseph stumbled, arms flailing, and then, he fell. The cold water engulfed him instantly. His clothes clung to him like a second skin, mud and leaves sticking to his hair, soaking through to his skin.<br>
Panic and humiliation surged at once. He thrashed for a moment, but his arms weren’t enough to resist the weight of his drenched clothing. When he finally managed to pull himself up onto the bank, he collapsed, shivering, his hands pressed to his face. Silent sobs shook his body.<br>
Isma’il, who had witnessed the whole scene from across the yard, ran over as fast as he dared. He was strong, yes, but he knew the consequences of retaliation, especially for a black boy. Injuring one of the boys could mean punishment far worse than the one Joseph had already endured. Still, he could not leave his friend alone.<br>
“Joseph… Joseph, it’s okay,” Isma’il said, kneeling beside him. His voice was low and steady. “I’m here. You’re okay. They can’t touch what’s inside you. Your kindness.”<br>
Joseph tried to wipe the water from his eyes, but it only blurred more, mixing with the tears that had already fallen. “They… they hate me,” he whispered, his voice cracking.<br>
“They don’t know you,” Isma’il said softly. “They only see what they fear, what they don’t understand. You… are worth more than their rudeness.”<br>
Joseph’s hands trembled in the mud, but slowly, he reached for Isma’il’s hand. He could feel the warmth and strength there. For the first time that day, he felt anchored, as if he were not entirely alone in a world that had suddenly become cold and hostile.<br>
“They took my notebooks… all my work…” Joseph’s voice was small, broken.<br>
Isma’il squeezed his hand gently. “Then we’ll start again. Together. We’ll rebuild it. One page at a time.”<br>
Joseph’s tears flowed freely now.<br>
“You’re right,” Joseph whispered under the coldness. “I… I won’t let them make me less. I can’t see them, but I can feel… I can feel everything else. And that’s enough.”<br>
The boys had moved on, laughing and jeering at someone else. Isma’il held Joseph’s hand and Joseph stood up.<br>
“You know,” Joseph said after a pause, his voice steadier now, “I’ve memorized the pages of my notebook. I remember everything. They can take the paper, but they can’t take the knowledge I carry inside me.”<br>
“R-Really?!” Isma’il questioned. Joseph nodded.<br>
Isma’il gasped then broke out into laughter with Joseph.<br>
Joseph took a deep breath, letting the cold, damp air fill his lungs. The pond had been humiliating, yes—but it had also left something behind: a new bond, a new friend, Isma’il.<br>
The bell rang, signaling the start of class.<br>
During the break…<br>
“Hey, you two!” a cheerful voice called as Joseph and Isma’il were opening their lunchboxes.<br>
Joseph turned his head—though he could not see clearly, the tone was unmistakable. A British boy, slightly taller than Joseph, with messy sandy hair and an easy grin, was walking toward them.<br>
“I’m George, a new student,” the boy said, extending his hand. “I saw what happened yesterday. Those guys were absolute jerks. You shouldn’t have to deal with that alone—and, well, I’m sorry I didn’t step in.”<br>
Joseph hesitated, then reached out to shake George’s hand. “You don’t need to be sorry. Thank you… I appreciate it,” he said softly.<br>
Isma’il, standing slightly behind Joseph, shifted nervously. His hands fiddled with the strap of his bag, and he avoided direct eye contact. “I… I’m Isma’il,” he said in a low voice.<br>
George smiled warmly. “Nice to meet you, Isma’il!” he said and shook his hand firmly.<br>
“I hope to see you both soon,” George added as he walked away.<br>
Days turned into weeks, and the friendship between Isma’il and Joseph deepened. Eventually, George became part of their small circle—one that felt more like a family than a friendship.<br>
During another break time…<br>
George plopped down between the two boys, greeting them cheerfully. “What’s for lunch today, gentlemen?”<br>
“I am eating Shiro Wat—split pea stew,” said Isma’il shyly.<br>
“And you, Joseph?” George asked.<br>
Joseph touched his lunchbox, opened it, and sniffed the contents gently. “Cholent—a stew,” he replied.<br>
George gasped dramatically. “He can identify food just by smelling it! Incredible! Blindness really does sharpen the other four senses.”<br>
“I brought cakes and biscuits,” said George proudly.<br>
As he spoke, his elbow accidentally knocked over his juice box, spilling a small puddle on the floor. “Oh no! Sorry! I’m a menace with beverages,” he muttered, trying to clean it up with a napkin.<br>
Isma’il giggled softly—a rare, sweet sound that made Joseph smile faintly. “At least you didn’t spill it on my stew,” Joseph said.<br>
George grinned mischievously. “If I did, you’d call me the Juice Villain of Birmingham.”<br>
Then he picked up a biscuit, held it like a microphone, and began singing in a ridiculous opera voice, “And now… presenting the one-man school choir!”<br>
Joseph chuckled, knocking lightly on George’s shoulder. “You’re lucky I can’t see your face. Otherwise, I’d be laughing too hard.”<br>
Isma’il laughed outright this time—a bright, genuine laugh that filled the lunchroom.<br>
George held up his biscuit like a trophy. “Victory! I made someone laugh!”<br>
Joseph smiled, touching the biscuit thoughtfully. “I don’t know if it’s the biscuit or your ridiculous singing, but… okay, you win,” he said.<br>
George grinned, puffing his chest proudly. “Ah, you see, it’s the British charm! Works every time. Give me a few more months, and I’ll have both of you eating pudding and drinking tea like proper gentlemen.”<br>
Isma’il laughed softly. “I doubt that. You tried to convince us last week, and we nearly burned the tea kettle.”<br>
George gasped dramatically. “That was an experiment! My mum says innovation begins with mistakes.”<br>
Joseph shook his head with a small smile. “Well, in that case, you’re the most innovative person I’ve ever met.”<br>
They all laughed again, the sound blending warmly into the chatter of the lunchroom—until a harsh voice broke the peace.<br>
“Hey, terrorist! Give me your English notes,” a boy sneered as he walked toward Isma’il.<br>
The laughter died instantly.<br>
Isma’il stiffened and quietly handed over his notes without a word.<br>
Joseph turned toward the sound of the bully’s fading footsteps. “Leave them, Isma’il,” he said calmly. “Their rudeness has no weight in a heart full of kindness.”<br>
George’s grin faded, replaced with quiet respect. Joseph reached out and touched his face gently.<br>
“Why are you touching my face?” George asked softly.<br>
“To recognize you,” Joseph replied. “So that, no matter how the world changes, I’ll always know the faces of those who stood beside me.”<br>
George smiled. “You’re strange, Joseph… but the good kind of strange.”<br>
Joseph tilted his head, smiling faintly. “Then maybe there’s still hope for us all.”<br>
<b>Fifteen Years Later…</b><br>
The air of Birmingham was different now. The war was long gone, yet its echoes lived in scars, memories, and resilience. A tall building stood proudly in the city center, its signboard gleaming: “The Unity Foundation — Founded by Joseph Cohen & Isma’il Dawud.”<br>
Inside, photographs of their journey decorated the walls — images of school days, laughter, tears, and rallies against discrimination. The foundation had become a refuge for those silenced by prejudice — whether for race, faith, or disability.<br>
Joseph, now in his late twenties, walked with a cane in his right hand and a notebook in his left. His beard had grown neatly, and though his eyes remained clouded, they carried peace instead of sorrow.<br>
Isma’il stood beside him, wearing a neatly pressed suit and a calm smile. “You know,” he said, “I still remember that first day you touched my face. I thought you were weird.”<br>
Joseph chuckled. “And I thought you were too quiet for your own good.”<br>
Just then, the door burst open. “Guess who’s here!”<br>
It was George — older, broader, and now dressed in the polished confidence of a middle-class businessman. He carried a briefcase and, of course, a box of biscuits.<br>
“I brought nostalgia,” George said, waving the box dramatically. “And some investment proposals.”<br>
Isma’il laughed. “You and your biscuits haven’t changed.”<br>
Joseph turned toward the sound of his old friend’s voice. “George, the man with more crumbs than wisdom.”<br>
George grinned. “Hey, those crumbs financed half your meetings back in the day!”<br>
The three burst into laughter, their voices harmonizing like old songs that never faded.<br>
As they sat down in the boardroom, Joseph ran his fingers along the edge of the table and said, “Fifteen years ago, we were just three boys trying to understand the world. Now, maybe… we can help make it better.”<br>
Isma’il nodded. “Not just maybe. We will.”<br>
George raised a biscuit like a toast. “To unity, to hope, and to never spilling juice on anyone again.”<br>
They all laughed — and in that laughter was healing and unity.<br>
