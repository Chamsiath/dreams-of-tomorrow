“The smell of disinfectants and antiseptic cleaners mixed with the sharp, unpleasant odors of human waste, body fluids, and medical waste…” said Anne as she looked at her bandaged arm.<br>
“The same smell… every day,” Anne whispered to herself as she looked at the mirror next to her bed.<br>
“Mama, when will I leave this hospital?” asked Anne.<br>
“Soon, my dear. Soon,” said her mother as she gently caressed her frail nine-year-old daughter.<br>
“Mama, I want to leave this hospital before my tenth birthday,” said Anne.<br>
Her mother smiled softly, holding back tears. “By God’s grace, you will,” she said, then quietly left the hospital room.<br>
Outside, Bridget — Anne’s mother — spoke to a nurse.<br>
“Good morning, ma’am. Were you able to tell your child?” the nurse asked.<br>
“Tell her what?” Bridget replied, her voice trembling.<br>
“Concerning her life expectancy—” Before the nurse could finish, Bridget burst into tears. “I can’t… It’ll break her. I can’t! Not my little frail Anemone.”<br>
“Ma’am, please come,” said the nurse softly, leading her to the restroom.<br>
Anne had seen the entire conversation through the glass door of her hospital room. She clutched her IV stand, tears streaming down her pale cheeks as she went back to bed.<br>
“I already knew I wasn’t going to live long,” she thought to herself. “I feel as though I won’t reach my tenth birthday.”<br>
Someone knocked at the door.<br>
“Who is it?” Anne asked.<br>
“It’s me — Suzy!” said her best friend.<br>
“Enter, please,” said Anne, still gazing at the ceiling.<br>
Anne was born with a syndrome called Mitone Syndrome, discovered by Dr. Mitone. In this rare condition, the number of cells dying exceeds those being produced, and the body’s melanin levels drop drastically. It leads to severe weakness, fragile skin, a pale complexion, early white hair, grey eyes, and brittle bones. Even sunlight could injure Anne’s skin — she couldn’t remember the last time the sun had touched her cheeks.<br>
“Hello, Anemone. Or shall I say, Anne?” said Suzy, smiling.<br>
“Hello, Suzy,” said Anne with a forced smile as tears flowed down her cheeks.<br>
Suzy’s smile faded into concern.<br>
“What happened, Anne?” she asked as Anne began crying bitterly, her breathing growing uneven.<br>
On top of Mitone Syndrome, Anne also had asthma. She immediately grabbed her inhaler and took a puff, calming herself down.<br>
Anne explained everything to Suzy. Suzy already knew about Anne’s condition — and that she wouldn’t live long. Her mother, Olivia, had told her a few days earlier. Suzy had cried too, but she didn’t want to tell Anne. She didn’t want to break her heart.<br>
“Oh… okay,” said Suzy softly.<br>
Anne looked toward the black curtains in her room, her reflection faintly visible in the window.<br>
“If I had a dying wish… it would be to see the sun with my own eyes — to feel it on my skin, and to look at it, maybe for the first and last time,” said Anne quietly.<br>
“I’ll make it happen!” said Suzy suddenly.<br>
“How? Tell me… how? The very thing that can kill me is what you want me to see?” Anne replied as she swallowed her vitamin D pills.<br>
“This is the only vitamin D that cannot kill me — and I’m allowed to take it,” she added with a faint smile.<br>
“I–” Suzy started, but Anne cut her off gently.<br>
“Thank you for coming, Suzy… or shall I say, Suzanne?” Anne said without turning to face her.<br>
“Um… Bye,” said Suzy hesitantly.<br>
“Bye…” Anne whispered.<br>
As Suzy walked out, she thought to herself, “Anne doesn’t smile anymore. She looks like someone who’s lost everything. I feel so bad for her.” Tears welled in her eyes.<br>
“What happened, Suzy?” asked Olivia as her daughter climbed into the car.<br>
“I just feel sad for Anne…” Suzy sobbed.<br>
“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Olivia said, pulling her into a hug.<br>
Meanwhile, in Anne’s room…<br>
Anne noticed a bracelet on her bedside table — a friendship bracelet — and a small note beside it: “Love, Suzanne to Anemone.”<br>
She slipped it onto her wrist, smiled faintly, and whispered, “I pity myself for being pitied.” Then she took a sip of water and lay back on her bed.<br>
The next day…<br>
“It’s raining…” said Anne as she woke up.<br>
She went to her window and touched it.<br>
“It’s cold. I love the rain,” Anne said, smiling softly.<br>
Then someone marched behind her and covered her eyes.<br>
“Peek-a-boo!” said the man.<br>
Anne immediately knew who it was.<br>
“Papa!” she exclaimed.<br>
“Yes, it’s me!” said her father, laughing heartily.<br>
Anne smiled—really smiled—for the first time in a month. She loved her father dearly; her very first word had been Papa.<br>
Her father, Augustus, had been away for more than two months on an important business trip. During that time, Bridget took care of Anne, keeping her company with toys and videos. But she was busy too, so Anne was often alone.<br>
“I came to see you, my cute little Anemone!” Augustus said as he lifted Anne up.<br>
Bridget walked into the room.<br>
“Anne, you seem so happy today!” she said, smiling.<br>
“Mama, that’s because it’s been three months since I’ve seen Papa—and six months since you both visited me at the same time!” Anne said cheerfully.<br>
“Happy before-birthday!” said her father.<br>
Bridget laughed. “Augustus, her birthday is a week from now.”<br>
“I know,” he said playfully. “And I got you…”—he dropped Anne gently on the bed, opened his bag, and pulled out a small box—<br>
“...chocolate ice cream!”<br>
Anne’s eyes widened with joy. “Yay, ice cream!” she shouted, crying tears of happiness.<br>
After enjoying the ice cream, she took her digestive pills as usual. Bridget left to go back to work.<br>
“Anne, your hair is turning white, and your eyes are losing their color,” her father said quietly, sitting beside her.<br>
“Papa?” Anne said softly.<br>
“Yes, my dear?” he replied.<br>
“Am I ugly?” she asked, tears welling in her eyes.<br>
“No! Never!” said her father firmly.<br>
Anne grabbed the mirror and looked at her reflection.<br>
“My hair is basically white, one of my eyes is grey and the other is turning grey… my skin is pale and fragile. I’m always covered in bandages,” she said, crying harder.<br>
“Don’t ever say that,” said her father, his voice trembling. “You are beautiful—my little, precious Anemone.”<br>
He knelt down beside her bed, wiped her tears, and whispered, “So don’t cry, my dear.”<br>
Then he hugged Anne gently as she sobbed into his chest.<br>
After Anne had calmed down, Augustus said he had to leave—but when Anne began crying again, he stayed with her for five more days.<br>
On the day he finally left, he smiled and said, “See you on your birthday, Anne!”<br>
“See you in two days, Papa!” said Anne, waving with a bright smile as he walked away.<br>
In Suzy’s home…<br>
Suzy was scribbling on her paper, planning how she would help Anne see the sun for her 10th birthday.<br>
“Okay! So I’m going to escort Anne to the toilet, and when the coast is clear, I’ll run with her downstairs so she can see the sun. What do you think, teddy bears?” Suzy asked, talking to her toys.<br>
“I think it’s a good idea,” she said in a little voice, pretending a teddy bear had spoken.<br>
“Yes! Yes!" another “teddy" agreed, according to Suzy’s imagination.<br>
Finally, Suzy clapped her hands. “I’m going to tell Anne! Muahaha! Muahaha! Muahaha!” she laughed, bouncing excitedly.<br>
“Suzy, it’s nighttime. Go to bed!” called Olivia.<br>
“Sorry, Mom,” Suzy said, and Olivia gently closed the door.<br>
The next day, Suzy excitedly told Anne her plan, making Anne smile softly.<br>
“So… what do you think?” asked Suzy.<br>
“I want… I want to see the sun!” Anne whispered.<br>
“Don’t worry! You will!” Suzy said, laughing as she climbed onto Anne’s bed, making Anne squirm a little.<br>
Just then, Olivia came in and saw that Suzy was disturbing Anne. She gently guided Suzy back home.<br>
The next day…<br>
Anne woke up at midnight and couldn’t fall back asleep until 3 a.m. So, she softly sang to herself,<br>
“Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to me…”<br>
As her fragile voice faded, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her chest. She clutched her heart and began wheezing before coughing up a small drop of blood.<br>
Anne sighed weakly, wiped her hand, and drank some water. Exhaustion overcame her, and she finally drifted back to sleep.<br>
8 a.m., the morning of her birthday…<br>
“Rise and shine, my dear! Happy birthday!” said Bridget, smiling as she turned on the lights.<br>
“Good morning, Mama,” Anne yawned softly.<br>
Bridget gently helped her to the bathroom, bathed her, and dressed her. Some might wonder why she still bathed her ten-year-old daughter — but Bridget was an overly protective mother. She feared Anne might accidentally hurt her fragile skin with the sponge. She even paid a night nurse, Annabelle, to watch over Anne, though the nurse often fell asleep during her shift.<br>
After dressing her, Bridget clipped a small bow onto Anne’s short bob of white hair and took a photo. Anne looked at the picture and frowned at her mismatched eyes — one grey, one still turning. She then covered one with an eyepatch and asked her mother to take another picture. This time, she smiled.<br>
Bridget remembered what Augustus had told her about Anne’s struggle with self-esteem.<br>
“Anne, you look beautiful — with and without that eyepatch,” said Bridget softly.<br>
“Thank you, Mom,” said Anne, smiling faintly.<br>
“I’m coming…” Bridget said as she stepped out for a moment.<br>
As Bridget was away, Suzy quietly sneaked into the room.<br>
“Hey, Anemone,” said Suzy.<br>
“Hello, Suzanne,” Anne replied.<br>
“You look so beautiful,” said Suzy.<br>
“Thank you,” said Anne, smiling softly.<br>
Suzy grinned, put on her sunglasses, and handed Anne another pair — along with a fake moustache.<br>
“Let’s go!” she whispered, holding Anne’s bandaged arm gently.<br>
They tiptoed into the hallway.<br>
“Good morning, ma’am,” both girls said in unison as they passed a nurse.<br>
“Good morning, girls,” replied the nurse cheerfully. But as she looked closer, she frowned.<br>
“Wait a minute… what are you, Anemone Boleyn?”<br>
“Anne, run!” Suzy yelled, grabbing her hand. The two bolted down the corridor, Suzy running at full speed.<br>
“Wait!” shouted the nurse, chasing after them.<br>
They hid in the janitor’s closet, breathing heavily. Outside, they heard voices.<br>
“Where is she?” said the nurse.<br>
“Where’s who?” asked another nurse.<br>
“Anemone Boleyn — and a little girl with her!”<br>
“I haven’t seen them,” replied the second nurse.<br>
The nurses’ footsteps faded as they split up to search.<br>
Meanwhile, near the doctor’s office…<br>
“I saw her coughing droplets of blood, ma’am,” said Nurse Annabelle to Bridget.<br>
Bridget’s face turned pale. She rushed upstairs to Anne’s room — but when she didn’t find her daughter, panic filled her heart.<br>
Back in the janitor’s closet, Suzy whispered, “Okay, they’re gone. Let’s move before they come back!”<br>
Anne took a puff from her inhaler, trying to calm her breathing. The running had triggered a small asthma attack. Suzy held her again — but her grip left a red mark on Anne’s fragile arm. Anne quietly took a bandage from her skirt pocket and covered it.<br>
“I’m scared… I’m scared of the sun,” said Anne, tears welling in her eyes. “I don’t want it to hurt me — but I want to see it.”<br>
“Don’t worry,” said Suzy softly, “you will.”<br>
She peeked outside — the coast was clear. Then she smiled. “Let’s go.”<br>
They slipped into the hallway leading to the reception hall.<br>
“Are you ready?” asked Suzy.<br>
Anne breathed deeply, her heart pounding. “Yes… I’m ready.”<br>
“Here goes nothing!” said Suzy, tightening her grip as they ran toward the glass doors.<br>
The hospital’s automatic doors slid open — and the golden sunlight poured in.<br>
Anne stopped. She lifted her head slowly, tears spilling down her cheeks.<br>
She took off her moustache, then her sunglasses, and stared at the bright, blinding sun.<br>
Suzy began singing softly through her tears,<br>
“Happy birthday to you… happy birthday to you… happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to Anemone…”<br>
Anne turned to her and smiled faintly.<br>
“Here’s my present to you,” whispered Suzy.<br>
Suddenly, a voice screamed, “Anemone!”<br>
Anne turned — her mother was running toward her, eyes wide with fear.<br>
Anne looked back at Suzy, then at the sun. She squeezed Suzy’s hand and whispered, “Suzy… I don’t feel so good…”<br>
Her mismatched eyes shimmered in the sunlight for the first — and maybe the last — time before she fainted.<br>
She woke up to find herself in the hospital. Her mom ran to Anne.<br>
“You’ve been asleep for a week. Are you all right?” asked Bridget.<br>
“Yes, mama,” said Anne softly.<br>
Bridget held Anne’s hand tightly and said softly,<br>
“Later that evening, on your birthday, Dr. Sebastian analyzed your blood under the microscope. He told me that what he saw amazed him. Your cells, the ones that used to be weak and pale, had started moving and dividing on their own. They were glowing faintly under the light.”<br>
She paused for a moment before continuing, her voice trembling with awe.<br>
“He ran more tests, and all of them showed the same thing. Something had triggered a regeneration in your body. So he called me immediately. He said, ‘Mrs. Boleyn, your daughter’s blood is healing itself.’”<br>
Bridget smiled faintly through her tears.<br>
“I couldn’t believe it. I asked him how that was possible. And he told me, ‘The sunlight, Mrs. Boleyn. The sunlight must’ve triggered something… maybe what we thought was a weakness was actually the key all along.’ He laughed softly and said, ‘It seems age has gotten the best of me, hasn’t it?’ Then he smiled and added, ‘Mrs. Boleyn, your daughter’s cure… is the sun.’”<br>
At those words, Bridget broke into tears. Anne was in shock—it took her a moment to process what she had just heard. When it finally sank in, she hugged her mother tightly and began to cry too.<br>
“Finally… I can look at the sky. I can live longer. I can live… thank God,” Anne said between joyful wheezes, tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>
Over the next few weeks, Anne was exposed to sunlight for short periods each day. It hurt at first—her skin tingled, burned, and she cried from the sting—but the pain never lasted long. Soon, the stinging became warmth. The warmth became strength. The strength became joy. The joy became hope.<br>
By the end of the month, she could walk freely into the hospital garden without fear. Her mismatched eyes shimmered under the morning glow, and for the first time in her life, Anne laughed beneath the sun.<br>
“I’m happy. I can live. I can breathe,” Anne said softly from the swing, her voice full of wonder.<br>
“I’m happy for you, Anne,” said Suzy with a wide smile.<br>
“So am I,” Anne whispered, looking up at the sun, the light that had once hurt her, now healing her.<br>
