“Bye, Mama!” said young John cheerfully.<br>
“Bye…” his mother replied softly—unaware that it would be the last time she would ever see her son.<br>
A tragic airplane crash occurred in Oklahoma that day. Everyone on board died—except for one pilot. Among the victims was John’s mother, Rebecca.<br>
Years later, John woke up drenched in sweat, the same nightmare haunting him again. It was always that last goodbye. He glanced at the framed photo of his mother beside his bed, then turned it face down on the table, unable to bear looking at it. But when he fell back asleep, he dreamt of her once more.<br>
…Morning arrived…<br>
John went to the dining room.<br>
“Good morning, John!” said his father as he was making omelets for his son.<br>
“Dad, I’m 18. I can make omelets on my own,” said John as he began washing the plates.<br>
His father, Kai, pinched his cheek. “You know, in Hawaiian, when someone annoys us we say…”<br>
Then both of them said in unison, “Kulikuli!” and started laughing.<br>
“Aren’t you late for… what do we call it in English again? Um—Kulanui!” said his father.<br>
“It’s not called ‘Kulanui,’ Dad, that’s Hawaiian. It’s called university,” said John.<br>
“Oh yes… so are you late?” asked the father.<br>
“No,” replied John. “Actually, I’m early,” he said as he grabbed his toast and omelet and headed off to university.<br>
His academy was called Flight Academy of Skys, founded by Captain Skys, an extremely skilled pilot. John was studying aeronautical engineering and pilot training.<br>
He sat down in class, and when the lesson began, the teacher entered and closed the door.<br>
“Anyone who is late shall not enter this class until the end,” said the professor.<br>
He came to the center of the room, faced the students, and said,<br>
“Welcome to university, students! I am your Physics professor, Dr. Gilbert Alexander. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. We shall commence with Unit 1 of Physics—Kinematics. So, what is Kinematics…”<br>
The professor continued as John opened his notebook and began writing.<br>
…Break time in the canteen…<br>
“Um, hello?” someone said, making John turn around.<br>
“Do we know each other?” asked John in confusion.<br>
“Yes, we do! I’m William De LaChaise. We were friends in primary school,” said William.<br>
“Oh! William. How are you doing?” John asked as they sat down to talk.<br>
“Fine. So, I'm just curious… Why are you in a flight school? Didn’t you say you wanted to be a doctor?” asked William, making John chuckle.<br>
“True, I wanted to be a doctor. But you know, as you grow up, your goals change,” said John, his mind wandering to the news of the airplane crash in Oklahoma.<br>
“The 2012 Oklahoma airplane crash,” said John as he looked at William. “Do you know about it?”<br>
“Yes, I do. The one where 100 passengers and one pilot died, with only a severely injured pilot who survived,” said William as he sipped his tea.<br>
“Among them…” John said as he looked toward the sky, “was my mother.”<br>
William paused momentarily.<br>
“I want to be a pilot. I want to inspire and lead like my mother. My mother, Rebecca, was a retired pilot. Her motto was, ‘If you ever get lost, look at the skies.’” John smiled softly, then looked back at William.<br>
“So, I shall look at the skies for as long as it takes until I reach my dream,” said John with passion.<br>
“Anyway, what do you want to be?” asked John.<br>
“I want to be a military pilot,” said William.<br>
“Oh, okay—” said John as the bell rang.<br>
After John’s lectures, he headed off to his part-time job as a waiter in a chic restaurant called La Rose. The staff always entered through the back door. He went to the staff restroom, combed his hair neatly, straightened his uniform, and stepped into the bustling kitchen.<br>
“Good evening, Steve,” said John to the chef.<br>
“Good evening, John. Looking sharp as always,” Steve replied with a wink.<br>
“You know it,” John said with a grin.<br>
A waiter handed Steve a list of orders. Steve clapped his hands to get everyone’s attention.<br>
“Alright, listen up, chefs! Tonight marks the anniversary of La Rose. The founder himself will be dining with us for the first time in ten years! Let’s make sure tonight’s dishes are unforgettable.”<br>
“Aye, aye, sir!” the chefs chorused.<br>
John chuckled.<br>
“They sound like a pirate crew,” said Sasha, one of the waitresses.<br>
“Indeed,” John replied, smiling as he stepped into the main restaurant.<br>
“Waiter, waiter!” a voice called from across the room.<br>
“Yes, sir?” John replied, walking toward the table.<br>
“Good evening, sirs and mademoiselles,” John greeted with practiced elegance.<br>
“What a gentleman,” one of the ladies at the table said with a giggle.<br>
Then John froze.<br>
“John, do you remember me? Mark Quitton, your classmate in high school,” said Mark.<br>
John’s eyes widened. It was him—his high school bully. Memories of soaked textbooks, cruel laughter, and hands around his neck flashed in his mind. He swallowed hard but forced a polite smile.<br>
“How may I help you this lovely evening?” he asked, steadying his voice.<br>
“We’d like two plates of Beef Wellington and five chocolate soufflés,” Mark said casually.<br>
“Duly noted,” John replied, jotting it down before hurrying back to the kitchen.<br>
Inside, his hands trembled slightly as he passed the order slip to Steve.<br>
“You okay, kid?” Steve asked, noticing his pale expression.<br>
“Yeah… just tired,” John muttered.<br>
Hours passed. John served tables, refilled drinks, and smiled through exhaustion. When he returned to Mark’s table to deliver the dishes, Mark smirked.<br>
“So, the kid who used to run from me serves food now? Life’s funny, huh?” he sneered quietly.<br>
John took a slow breath. “Yes,” he said calmly, “life is funny… it also gives second chances.”<br>
Mark frowned, caught off guard. John placed the plates down gracefully, bowed slightly, and walked away.<br>
“Enjoy your meal,” said John.<br>
By the time the restaurant closed, John was the last to leave. As he walked home, he looked up at the beautiful night sky and smiled softly.<br>
“Mom,” he whispered, “I didn’t run this time.”<br>
The following week, his Flight Simulator Training exams began. The sunlight spilled through his window. John rubbed his eyes, stretched, and looked at the photo of his mother again. This time, he didn’t turn it face down.<br>
“Good morning, Mom,” he said with a small smile. “Another day closer to the skies.”<br>
At the academy, he entered the simulator room. It was a large space filled with blinking panels and the faint scent of machine oil. He noticed a man with white-blue eyes and blonde hair wearing a military uniform.<br>
“Good morning, students!” the man said.<br>
“Good morning, sir!” the students replied.<br>
“Good! I am your instructor, Captain Hayes. Today, we shall be practicing your flying skills using a simulator,” said Captain Hayes.<br>
“Yes, sir!” the students chorused.<br>
“As the proverb goes, when everything seems to be against you…” the Captain began.<br>
“Um…” a student murmured.<br>
“When everything seems to be against you, remember that an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. Repeat!” said the Captain.<br>
“When everything seems to be against you, remember that an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it!” the students repeated.<br>
“Good!” said Captain Hayes.<br>
“You!” the captain said, pointing toward John.<br>
“Yes, sir!” John said as he stood at attention.<br>
“Get on the pilot simulator seat and show us what you’ve got!”<br>
“Yes, sir!” John answered.<br>
As he sat in the pilot’s seat, his hands shook slightly. Captain Hayes noticed.<br>
“Nervous, boy?” asked the captain.<br>
John nodded faintly. “A little.”<br>
“Good,” said the captain with a grin. “Means you care about what you’re doing.”<br>
John put on the virtual reality headset, and the simulator hummed to life. The virtual sky appeared before him—a vast blue expanse that almost felt real. He took a deep breath, gripped the control stick, and whispered, “For you, Mom.”<br>
The simulator exercise continued. Clouds rushed past and virtual winds buffeted the plane. John maneuvered carefully, recalling every tip his mother had left in her journal.<br>
“Steady, John… steady,” he whispered to himself.<br>
Minutes later, the simulator announced the final checkpoint. John lined up the plane for landing. The ground rushed toward him.<br>
“Almost there… almost—”<br>
Suddenly, an alert flashed red. A simulated engine warning screamed. John panicked, pulling the controls too sharply. The plane veered and crashed.<br>
“Failed,” the simulator voice intoned.<br>
John’s heart sank. His dream of flying smoothly was shattered. He removed the headset and ran his fingers through his hair, trying to hide his frustration.<br>

Captain Hayes approached, calm but firm. His eyes softened as he studied John. “I knew your mother, Rebecca,” he said quietly, a faint smile on his lips.<br>

John froze, eyes wide. “You… you do?!”<br>

“She was an exceptional pilot,” Hayes continued. “You have her courage in you.”<br>

John nodded, swallowing hard, the words settling in. Then, as he passed a small table in the corner, a leather-bound journal caught his eye — dusty and old, with a faint gold-embossed title: Rebecca’s Flight Notes. His breath caught.<br>

John nodded, swallowing hard. As he passed a small table in the corner, he noticed a leather-bound journal, dusty and old, with a faint gold-embossed title: Rebecca’s Flight Notes. His breath caught.<br>
He opened the journal. Each entry was filled with advice, sketches of planes, tips for handling turbulence, and reflections on courage. His mother’s voice seemed to whisper, “When the wind pushes against you, rise higher, John.”<br>
A spark ignited in him. He may have failed today, but he had the guidance of the person he admired most.<br>
“Tomorrow,” he murmured, “I’ll do better. I’ll fly… for you, Mom. I’ll reach the skies,” he said as he gripped the book to himself.<br>
After the simulator assignment, Captain Hayes grouped everyone.<br>
“The next simulator exam shall be in a week,” said Captain Hayes.<br>
As the sun set outside the academy, John walked home, notes in hand, determined to face the skies again. He didn’t know exactly how, but he knew hope was waiting for him—and so was his mother, in every word she had left behind.<br>
When he arrived home, John put himself to work. He began watching pilot tutorials, studying physics, and memorizing flight procedures.<br>
“This is my first year in this flight academy. Let’s do this!” John said to himself.<br>
Days turned into nights, and nights into dawns. John studied tirelessly, sometimes falling asleep at his desk beside his mother’s photograph. The week passed like a blur, until Monday, the day of the simulator exam.<br>
“Alright, cadets,” said Captain Hayes, “today, you’ll prove you have what it takes to rule the skies.”<br>
John’s palms were sweaty, but his eyes were steady. He climbed into the simulator once more, the familiar hum filling his ears.<br>
“For you, Mom,” he whispered again.<br>
The virtual plane took off—smooth, steady, precise. Every turn, every climb, every descent was perfect. When the simulation ended, Captain Hayes gave a proud nod.<br>
“Well done, Cadet Kalama. You’ve earned your first wings.”<br>
Tears ran down John’s cheeks. He had done it.<br>
“I did it,” he said while crying. “I got my first wings,” John said softly.<br>
“Hey, hey, hey! Man up! Stop crying in front of the ladies!” said Captain Hayes.<br>
John then wiped his tears then said, “Sir, yes, sir!”<br>
✈️ <b>Three Years Later…</b><br>
The auditorium was filled with uniforms, chatter, and excitement. Gold rays of afternoon sunlight streamed through the high windows of the Flight Academy of Skys. The graduates stood proudly in a line, their crisp jackets gleaming with their academy badges.<br>
Captain Hayes stood at the podium, his posture proud and firm.<br>
“Today, we celebrate not just your success,” he said, scanning the crowd, “but your persistence—the courage to keep flying even when the wind was against you.”<br>
John stood among his fellow cadets, chest rising with pride and disbelief. He had made it. After all the sleepless nights, the failures, and the memories that once held him down—he had finally risen above.<br>
When his name was called, he stepped forward to receive his pilot certificate.<br>
“John Kalama,” the announcer said, “for exceptional performance, resilience, and discipline in flight simulation and aeronautical training.”<br>
John shook Captain Hayes’s hand.<br>
“You’ve done your mother proud, son,” the captain said with a small smile.<br>
“Thank you, sir,” John replied, voice trembling slightly.<br>
After the ceremony, as students threw their caps in the air, John walked to the open field beside the academy. The air smelled of jet fuel and fresh rain. He looked up at the clouds and whispered,<br>
“Mom… I did it.”<br>
A gentle breeze brushed his face, and for a brief moment, he felt as if she were right there—smiling, not watching over him, but with him.<br>
He glanced down at his certificate, then back to the endless sky.<br>
“This isn’t the end,” he said softly. “It’s just the beginning.”<br>
He turned toward the hangar, where a single small plane awaited him—his first real flight test.<br>
John climbed into the cockpit, heart pounding.<br>
The engine roared to life. As the wheels left the ground, he grinned and said into his headset,<br>
“For you, Mom. Always.”<br>
The plane ascended into the open blue.<br>

✈️ <b>Two Years Later…</b><br>
The intercom buzzed softly.<br>
“Hello, ladies and gentlemen,” came a calm, confident voice. “This is your regional pilot, John Kalama. Please fasten your seatbelts — we are ready for takeoff.”<br>
John smiled behind the cockpit controls.<br>
He glanced at a small photograph taped near the throttle — his mother’s smiling face.<br>
“If you ever get lost, look at the skies,” he whispered, remembering the words she used to tell him while stitching his clothes.<br>
The engines roared to life, turbines spinning faster as the aircraft began to roll down the runway. John’s heart beat steadily — not from fear this time, but from fulfillment. As the plane lifted off, the clouds stretched endlessly before him, bathed in the warm orange glow of dusk.<br>
He smiled softly.<br>
He was finally home — in the skies.<br>
